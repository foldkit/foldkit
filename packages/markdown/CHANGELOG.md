# @foldkit/markdown

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3feb9ba: Bump Effect to `4.0.0-rc.108` (from `4.0.0-beta.107`), the first Effect v4 release candidate. Foldkit's peer dependencies now require `effect@4.0.0-rc.108` and `@effect/platform-browser@4.0.0-rc.108`.

  Pin your Effect packages to `4.0.0-rc.108` to match this release. While Effect v4 is in prerelease, pin the exact version rather than a range:

  ```sh
  pnpm add effect@4.0.0-rc.108 @effect/platform-browser@4.0.0-rc.108
  pnpm add -D @effect/vitest@4.0.0-rc.108
  ```

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 96303a5: Add opt-in Schema-validated frontmatter support to the Vite plugin. Pass a `frontmatter` Schema struct in the plugin options to enable flat `key: value` frontmatter blocks: fields are validated at build time the same way island attributes are, and the validated fields are emitted as a `frontmatter` named export on the compiled module. `parseMarkdownWithFrontmatter` exposes the same parsing for scripts. Documents with frontmatter still fail the build when no schema is configured.

### Patch Changes

- 4a351f0: Memoize `decodeDocument` on a `WeakMap` keyed by the wire object, so decoding the same compiled markdown module again returns the document from the first decode. A module's wire object is immutable build output and the decode is deterministic, so a cached document can never disagree with a fresh one, and each entry is collected along with the module holding its key. Calling `decodeDocument` from a view no longer re-decodes on every render, and consumers no longer need a cache of their own.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 35c2560: Correct the root view example in the 0.134.0 migration guide. The snippet returned an `Html` value annotated as `Document`, which does not compile. `Document` is `{ title, body, ... }`, so both the before and after form now return that struct.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a313fc4: Supply the html builder from the render frame.

  `html<Message>()` is removed. It returned a process-wide singleton cast to a caller-chosen type, so the Message type parameter was a phantom: the developer wrote it and the runtime ignored it. A shared view helper that named the app's Message worked at the root and broke inside a Submodel, because the boundary rejected the foreign Message when the handler fired. `Html` is not parameterized by Message, so nothing caught it at compile time.

  The builder now comes from the frame that renders the view and cannot be conjured, so the Message type can no longer disagree with the boundary that will dispatch it.

  ## Migration

  Views receive `h` as their last parameter. Delete the line that built it.

  ```ts
  // before
  export const view = (model: Model): Document => {
    const h = html<Message>()
    return {
      title: 'Example',
      body: h.div([], [h.button([h.OnClick(Clicked())], ['go'])]),
    }
  }

  // after
  export const view = (model: Model, h: HtmlBuilder<Message>): Document => ({
    title: 'Example',
    body: h.div([], [h.button([h.OnClick(Clicked())], ['go'])]),
  })
  ```

  The same applies to `crash.view`, which now takes `(context, h)`, and to `Scene.scene`'s `view`.

  Submodel views take the builder after their view inputs:

  ```ts
  // before
  Submodel.defineView<Model, Message, ViewInputs>((model, viewInputs) => { ... })
  // after
  Submodel.defineView<Model, Message, ViewInputs>((model, viewInputs, h) => { ... })
  ```

  A view helper defined at module level takes the builder as its last parameter, and callers pass it along:

  ```ts
  const rowView = (item: Item, h: HtmlBuilder<Message>): Html => ...
  ```

  A memoized helper receives it through the existing args array. The builder is referentially stable, so memoization is unaffected:

  ```ts
  lazyRow(rowView, [item, h])
  ```

  Where no builder is in scope, typically module scope, use `inertHtml`. It is typed `HtmlBuilder<never>`, so element and attribute constructors work while every event-handler constructor is uncallable. Its attributes are `Attribute<never>` and flow into any Message universe by covariance, which also makes it the builder for library code emitting handler-free attribute bundles:

  ```ts
  import { inertHtml as ih } from 'foldkit/html'

  const PagefindBody = ih.DataAttribute('pagefind-body', '')
  ```

  Inside a view, use the view's own `h`. The view already holds a builder, and reaching past it is the habit that made a caller-chosen Message type possible to begin with.

  `@foldkit/ui` components take the consumer's builder as their last argument, and the explicit type argument goes away because it is inferred from the builder:

  ```ts
  // before
  Button.view<Message>({ toView, onClick: Clicked() })
  // after
  Button.view({ toView, onClick: Clicked() }, h)
  ```

  `Canvas.view(config, h)` and the `CustomElement` spec's `withMessage(h)` follow the same shape.

  `crash.view` receives `HtmlBuilder<never>`, not the app's builder. The crash view renders after the dispatch loop has stopped, so a Message it produced could never reach `update`. `never` makes that structural: `h.OnClick(...)` is a compile error rather than a handler that silently does nothing, and a reload control uses `h.Attribute('onclick', 'location.reload()')` as before.

  `DragAndDrop.droppable` and `DragAndDrop.sortable` lose their type parameter and return `ReadonlyArray<Attribute<never>>`. Both produce only data attributes, never handlers, so `never` is the accurate Message type and the result flows into any Message universe by covariance. Drop the explicit type argument: `droppable<Message>(id)` becomes `droppable(id)`. `DragAndDrop.draggable` is unchanged and stays parameterized, because it does dispatch.

  The stateless `@foldkit/ui` helpers name their type parameter `Message`. Button, Fieldset, Input, RadioGroup, Select, and Textarea previously called it `ParentMessage` while Checkbox, Disclosure, and Switch called it `Message`, though none of them opens a Submodel boundary, so there is no child Message for a parent to be named against. Components that do lift a child Message, such as DragAndDrop, keep `ParentMessage`. Type parameter names are not part of the type contract, so call sites are unchanged.

  `h.submodel` now types the lift: `toParentMessage` must return the embedding builder's Message, where it previously returned `unknown`. Lifting into the wrong Message union is a compile error.

  `childAttributes` and slotted Submodels are unchanged.

  ## Testing a view

  A view can no longer be called directly in a test, because there is no way to produce a builder outside a render. Render through the `Scene` harness instead, which supplies one the same way the runtime does. Tests that asserted on the result of `view(model)` become tests that assert on what the scene rendered.

  ## What this does not cover

  A view can still assign its builder to module state where another frame reads it. TypeScript cannot express the restriction that would prevent that, so treat a stored builder as a bug the types will not catch.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 7986b8b: Show the imports in every README snippet. The setup, render, islands, and `parseMarkdown` examples used `defineConfig`, `tailwindcss`, `foldkit`, `h`, `S`, and `islandAttributes` without showing where they came from. The shared island module is now named, so the Vite config and view snippets import from it concretely, and the two view fragments are wrapped in functions so `h` has a visible origin. Documentation only, no API changes.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- c94b028: Reword the package tagline: write markdown files, get Foldkit views with live islands.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e818ee9: New package: markdown compiled at build time into typed Foldkit views. The Vite plugin (`@foldkit/markdown/vite`) parses imported `.md` files with remark, validates them against an Effect Schema vocabulary (CommonMark minus raw HTML, plus GFM tables, strikethrough, and directives), and emits typed document modules, so no parser ships to the browser. The runtime entry ships the AST schemas, `decodeDocument`, and a `view` fold with unstyled semantic defaults, per-node view overrides, and island directives that place live application views, including stateful Submodels, between paragraphs. Islands declare their attributes as Schema structs: the plugin's `islands` option validates every directive against them at build time (unknown names, unknown attributes, and malformed values all fail with file and line), and `islandsFor` pairs the same definitions with typed views whose attributes arrive already decoded.
