## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 64387ef: Routes and other tagged unions now use the same one-object declaration as Messages. The old `r` and `ts` helpers are gone:

  - Use `defineRouteUnion` for `AppRoute`.
  - Use `defineTaggedUnion` for Model states and other domain unions.
  - Use `taggedStruct` when a tagged struct must be declared on its own.

  Both union helpers return a Schema that also holds the variant constructors. For example, `AppRoute.Person` is the `Person` Schema, and `AppRoute.Person({ personId: 42 })` constructs a value. They also provide `match`, `guards`, `isAnyOf`, `subset`, and `members`. A `defineTaggedUnion` result can be passed directly to `Machine.define`. Message unions still expose only their constructors and exhaustive `match`.

  ## Migrate Routes

  Declare every route in one `AppRoute` object, then use variants through that namespace. Do not name the union `Route`; Foldkit already uses that name for the route module.

  Before:

  ```typescript
  import { int, literal, mapTo, r, root, slash } from 'foldkit/route'

  export const HomeRoute = r('Home')
  export const PersonRoute = r('Person', { personId: S.Number })
  export const NotFoundRoute = r('NotFound', { path: S.String })

  export const AppRoute = S.Union([HomeRoute, PersonRoute, NotFoundRoute])

  export type HomeRoute = typeof HomeRoute.Type
  export type PersonRoute = typeof PersonRoute.Type
  export type NotFoundRoute = typeof NotFoundRoute.Type
  export type AppRoute = typeof AppRoute.Type

  export const homeRouter = pipe(root, mapTo(HomeRoute))
  export const personRouter = pipe(
    literal('people'),
    slash(int('personId')),
    mapTo(PersonRoute),
  )

  export const urlToAppRoute = parseUrlWithFallback(routeParser, NotFoundRoute)
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  import {
    defineRouteUnion,
    int,
    literal,
    mapTo,
    root,
    slash,
  } from 'foldkit/route'

  export const AppRoute = defineRouteUnion({
    Home: {},
    Person: { personId: S.Number },
    NotFound: { path: S.String },
  })
  export type AppRoute = typeof AppRoute.Type

  export const homeRouter = pipe(root, mapTo(AppRoute.Home))
  export const personRouter = pipe(
    literal('people'),
    slash(int('personId')),
    mapTo(AppRoute.Person),
  )

  export const urlToAppRoute = parseUrlWithFallback(
    routeParser,
    AppRoute.NotFound,
  )
  ```

  The old `XxxRoute` suffix kept separate exports from colliding. `AppRoute` now provides that context, so write `AppRoute.Person({ personId: 42 })` instead of `PersonRoute({ personId: 42 })`.

  ## Migrate Route subsets

  Use `subset` when a Model or Schema accepts only some application Routes. This keeps the allowed Routes tied to `AppRoute` without declaring another union.

  Before:

  ```typescript
  export const LoggedOutRoute = S.Union([HomeRoute, LoginRoute, NotFoundRoute])
  export const LoggedInRoute = S.Union([
    DashboardRoute,
    SettingsRoute,
    NotFoundRoute,
  ])
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  export const LoggedOutRoute = AppRoute.subset(['Home', 'Login', 'NotFound'])
  export const LoggedInRoute = AppRoute.subset([
    'Dashboard',
    'Settings',
    'NotFound',
  ])
  ```

  `subset` includes only the tags you name. If you add a Route to `AppRoute` later, neither Schema above will accept it until you add its tag. There is no `omit`: an exclusion list would silently accept every Route added later.

  If a module needs to name one variant's type, export an alias beside `AppRoute` instead of repeating `typeof AppRoute.Person.Type`:

  ```typescript
  export type PersonRoute = typeof AppRoute.Person.Type
  ```

  ## Replace hand-written route guards

  Use `isAnyOf` when one guard accepts several tags.

  Before:

  ```typescript
  export const isBlogRoute = (
    route: AppRoute,
  ): route is BlogRoute | BlogPostRoute =>
    route._tag === 'Blog' || route._tag === 'BlogPost'
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  export const isBlogRoute = AppRoute.isAnyOf(['Blog', 'BlogPost'])
  ```

  ## Migrate domain unions

  Use `defineTaggedUnion` when the variants of a domain union can be declared together.

  Before:

  ```typescript
  import { ts } from 'foldkit/schema'

  export const NotSubmitted = ts('NotSubmitted')
  export const Submitting = ts('Submitting')
  export const SubmitSuccess = ts('SubmitSuccess')
  export const SubmitError = ts('SubmitError', { error: S.String })

  export const Submission = S.Union([
    NotSubmitted,
    Submitting,
    SubmitSuccess,
    SubmitError,
  ])
  export type Submission = typeof Submission.Type
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  import { defineTaggedUnion } from 'foldkit/schema'

  export const Submission = defineTaggedUnion({
    NotSubmitted: {},
    Submitting: {},
    SubmitSuccess: {},
    SubmitError: { error: S.String },
  })
  export type Submission = typeof Submission.Type
  ```

  Use the union's `match` method when every tag must be handled:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  M.value(submission).pipe(
    M.withReturnType<Html>(),
    M.tagsExhaustive({ ... }),
  )

  // After
  Submission.match<Html>(submission, { ... })
  ```

  Because `match` runs at runtime, a file that calls it must import the union as a value. Keep using Effect `Match` for partial matching, fallbacks, or one handler shared by several tags.

  ## Remove repeated union names from tags

  The union name now provides the context a tag needs. Prefer `ConnectionState.Connected` to `ConnectionState.ConnectionConnected`.

  Renaming a tag also changes its `_tag` value. Do not shorten tags stored in a Model, URL, or wire protocol unless that external value is meant to change.

  ## Rename `ts` to `taggedStruct`

  `taggedStruct` is the new name for `ts`. Most unions should move to `defineTaggedUnion`; `taggedStruct` remains for variants that must be declared separately.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { ts } from 'foldkit/schema'
  const TableRow = ts('TableRow', { cells: S.Array(TableCell) })

  // After
  import { taggedStruct } from 'foldkit/schema'
  const TableRow = taggedStruct('TableRow', { cells: S.Array(TableCell) })
  ```

  Use `taggedStruct` in these cases:

  - A recursive union, such as `Canvas.Shape` or the markdown AST.
  - A union assembled from variants owned by different modules, such as a parent Model built from two Submodel Models.
  - A tagged child struct that is not one variant of a choice, such as `TableRow`.
  - A variant created inside a generic Schema factory, such as `AsyncData`.

  If recursion forces one union in a module to use `taggedStruct`, use `taggedStruct` for the module's sibling unions too.

  ## Variants are no longer separate exports

  `Navigation` and `Interruptible` no longer export their variants as separate top-level names. Access each variant through its union instead.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  Navigation.Internal({ url })
  Interruptible.Interrupted()

  // After
  Navigation.UrlRequest.Internal({ url })
  Interruptible.Outcome.Interrupted()
  ```

  The DevTools protocol now follows the same rule. Its variants live under `Request`, `Response`, `Event`, `DiffValue`, and `MessageSchemaResult`. The `_tag` strings did not change, so old and new DevTools clients still speak the same wire protocol.

  `@foldkit/ui`, `@foldkit/devtools`, `@foldkit/devtools-mcp`, `@foldkit/markdown`, and `@foldkit/vite-plugin` now require Foldkit `>=0.153.0` because their published code calls these new APIs. Each gets a minor release so consumers on older pre-1.0 ranges do not receive an incompatible update.

  ## Lint

  `foldkit/no-empty-object-tagged-call` now catches no-field Route and domain constructors as well as Messages. It recognizes namespaces whose names end in Message, Route, or State, plus unions declared in the same file with Foldkit's union helpers. It does not assume every PascalCase namespace is a Foldkit union.

  The [Routing & Navigation guide](https://foldkit.dev/core/routing-and-navigation) covers the route union in depth, and the [Model guide](https://foldkit.dev/core/model) covers state modeling with `defineTaggedUnion`.

  ```

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3feb9ba: Bump Effect to `4.0.0-rc.108` (from `4.0.0-beta.107`), the first Effect v4 release candidate. Foldkit's peer dependencies now require `effect@4.0.0-rc.108` and `@effect/platform-browser@4.0.0-rc.108`.

  ```

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 96303a5: Add opt-in Schema-validated frontmatter support to the Vite plugin. Pass a `frontmatter` Schema struct in the plugin options to enable flat `key: value` frontmatter blocks: fields are validated at build time the same way island attributes are, and the validated fields are emitted as a `frontmatter` named export on the compiled module. `parseMarkdownWithFrontmatter` exposes the same parsing for scripts. Documents with frontmatter still fail the build when no schema is configured.

### Patch Changes

- 4a351f0: Memoize `decodeDocument` on a `WeakMap` keyed by the wire object, so decoding the same compiled markdown module again returns the document from the first decode. A module's wire object is immutable build output and the decode is deterministic, so a cached document can never disagree with a fresh one, and each entry is collected along with the module holding its key. Calling `decodeDocument` from a view no longer re-decodes on every render, and consumers no longer need a cache of their own.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 35c2560: Correct the root view example in the 0.134.0 migration guide. The snippet returned an `Html` value annotated as `Document`, which does not compile. `Document` is `{ title, body, ... }`, so both the before and after form now return that struct.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a313fc4: Supply the html builder from the render frame.

  `html<Message>()` is removed. It returned a process-wide singleton cast to a caller-chosen type, so the Message type parameter was a phantom: the developer wrote it and the runtime ignored it. A shared view helper that named the app's Message worked at the root and broke inside a Submodel, because the boundary rejected the foreign Message when the handler fired. `Html` is not parameterized by Message, so nothing caught it at compile time.

  The builder now comes from the frame that renders the view and cannot be conjured, so the Message type can no longer disagree with the boundary that will dispatch it.

  ## Migration

  Views receive `h` as their last parameter. Delete the line that built it.

  ```ts
  // before
  export const view = (model: Model): Document => {
    const h = html<Message>()
    return {
      title: 'Example',
      body: h.div([], [h.button([h.OnClick(Clicked())], ['go'])]),
    }
  }

  // after
  export const view = (model: Model, h: HtmlBuilder<Message>): Document => ({
    title: 'Example',
    body: h.div([], [h.button([h.OnClick(Clicked())], ['go'])]),
  })
  ```

  The same applies to `crash.view`, which now takes `(context, h)`, and to `Scene.scene`'s `view`.

  Submodel views take the builder after their view inputs:

  ```ts
  // before
  Submodel.defineView<Model, Message, ViewInputs>((model, viewInputs) => { ... })
  // after
  Submodel.defineView<Model, Message, ViewInputs>((model, viewInputs, h) => { ... })
  ```

  A view helper defined at module level takes the builder as its last parameter, and callers pass it along:

  ```ts
  const rowView = (item: Item, h: HtmlBuilder<Message>): Html => ...
  ```

  A memoized helper receives it through the existing args array. The builder is referentially stable, so memoization is unaffected:

  ```ts
  lazyRow(rowView, [item, h])
  ```

  Where no builder is in scope, typically module scope, use `inertHtml`. It is typed `HtmlBuilder<never>`, so element and attribute constructors work while every event-handler constructor is uncallable. Its attributes are `Attribute<never>` and flow into any Message universe by covariance, which also makes it the builder for library code emitting handler-free attribute bundles:

  ```ts
  import { inertHtml as ih } from 'foldkit/html'

  const PagefindBody = ih.DataAttribute('pagefind-body', '')
  ```

  Inside a view, use the view's own `h`. The view already holds a builder, and reaching past it is the habit that made a caller-chosen Message type possible to begin with.

  `@foldkit/ui` components take the consumer's builder as their last argument, and the explicit type argument goes away because it is inferred from the builder:

  ```ts
  // before
  Button.view<Message>({ toView, onClick: Clicked() })
  // after
  Button.view({ toView, onClick: Clicked() }, h)
  ```

  `Canvas.view(config, h)` and the `CustomElement` spec's `withMessage(h)` follow the same shape.

  `crash.view` receives `HtmlBuilder<never>`, not the app's builder. The crash view renders after the dispatch loop has stopped, so a Message it produced could never reach `update`. `never` makes that structural: `h.OnClick(...)` is a compile error rather than a handler that silently does nothing, and a reload control uses `h.Attribute('onclick', 'location.reload()')` as before.

  `DragAndDrop.droppable` and `DragAndDrop.sortable` lose their type parameter and return `ReadonlyArray<Attribute<never>>`. Both produce only data attributes, never handlers, so `never` is the accurate Message type and the result flows into any Message universe by covariance. Drop the explicit type argument: `droppable<Message>(id)` becomes `droppable(id)`. `DragAndDrop.draggable` is unchanged and stays parameterized, because it does dispatch.

  The stateless `@foldkit/ui` helpers name their type parameter `Message`. Button, Fieldset, Input, RadioGroup, Select, and Textarea previously called it `ParentMessage` while Checkbox, Disclosure, and Switch called it `Message`, though none of them opens a Submodel boundary, so there is no child Message for a parent to be named against. Components that do lift a child Message, such as DragAndDrop, keep `ParentMessage`. Type parameter names are not part of the type contract, so call sites are unchanged.

  `h.submodel` now types the lift: `toParentMessage` must return the embedding builder's Message, where it previously returned `unknown`. Lifting into the wrong Message union is a compile error.

  `childAttributes` and slotted Submodels are unchanged.

  ## Testing a view

  A view can no longer be called directly in a test, because there is no way to produce a builder outside a render. Render through the `Scene` harness instead, which supplies one the same way the runtime does. Tests that asserted on the result of `view(model)` become tests that assert on what the scene rendered.

  ## What this does not cover

  A view can still assign its builder to module state where another frame reads it. TypeScript cannot express the restriction that would prevent that, so treat a stored builder as a bug the types will not catch.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 7986b8b: Show the imports in every README snippet. The setup, render, islands, and `parseMarkdown` examples used `defineConfig`, `tailwindcss`, `foldkit`, `h`, `S`, and `islandAttributes` without showing where they came from. The shared island module is now named, so the Vite config and view snippets import from it concretely, and the two view fragments are wrapped in functions so `h` has a visible origin. Documentation only, no API changes.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- c94b028: Reword the package tagline: write markdown files, get Foldkit views with live islands.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e818ee9: New package: markdown compiled at build time into typed Foldkit views. The Vite plugin (`@foldkit/markdown/vite`) parses imported `.md` files with remark, validates them against an Effect Schema vocabulary (CommonMark minus raw HTML, plus GFM tables, strikethrough, and directives), and emits typed document modules, so no parser ships to the browser. The runtime entry ships the AST schemas, `decodeDocument`, and a `view` fold with unstyled semantic defaults, per-node view overrides, and island directives that place live application views, including stateful Submodels, between paragraphs. Islands declare their attributes as Schema structs: the plugin's `islands` option validates every directive against them at build time (unknown names, unknown attributes, and malformed values all fail with file and line), and `islandsFor` pairs the same definitions with typed views whose attributes arrive already decoded.
